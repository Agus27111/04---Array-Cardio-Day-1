What i was Learn

1. i am learning about arrays in jS
2. especially in the filter, map, reduce, sort, slice and split methods
3. Filter: Used to create a new array containing elements that pass a specific condition.
   Map: Creates a new array by transforming each element in an existing array based on a given function.
   Reduce: Aggregates all elements in an array into a single value based on a callback function and an initial value.
   Sort: Rearranges the elements of an array based on a specified sorting order.
   Slice: Extracts a section of elements from an array without modifying the original array.
   Split: Divides a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator.
